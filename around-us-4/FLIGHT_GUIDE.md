# ✈️ Flight Guide for Beginners

Never flown before? No problem! This guide will teach you the basics of flying in Around_Us.

## 🎮 Understanding the Controls

### Pitch (W/S) - Nose Up/Down
- **W** - Pitches nose DOWN (descend)
- **S** - Pitches nose UP (climb)

Think of it like leaning forward/backward in a car.

### Roll (A/D) - Banking
- **A** - Roll LEFT (left wing down)
- **D** - Roll RIGHT (right wing down)

This tilts the aircraft side to side.

### Yaw (Q/E) - Turning
- **Q** - Turn LEFT
- **E** - Turn RIGHT

Like turning a steering wheel.

### Throttle (Shift/Ctrl) - Speed
- **SHIFT** - Speed up
- **CTRL** - Slow down

Controls how fast you're flying.

## 🛫 Your First Flight

### 1. Taking Off

You start in the air, so you're already flying! But here's how to gain altitude:

1. Hold **SHIFT** to increase speed
2. Gently tap **S** to pitch up
3. Keep your wings level (no roll)
4. Watch your altitude increase!

### 2. Basic Flying

Once you're comfortable:

1. **Maintain altitude:** Balance pitch and throttle
2. **Fly straight:** Keep wings level (roll = 0°)
3. **Watch your speed:** Keep above 20 knots

### 3. Turning

To make a proper turn:

1. Roll with **A** or **D** (about 30° roll)
2. Pull up slightly with **S** to maintain altitude
3. Level wings when you're facing the right direction

### 4. Descending

To lose altitude safely:

1. Reduce throttle with **CTRL**
2. Pitch down gently with **W**
3. Don't go too fast! (below 100 knots)

## 📊 Understanding the HUD

### Top Left - Airspeed
- Measured in **knots** (nautical miles per hour)
- Minimum: ~20 kts (stay above this!)
- Maximum: ~150 kts
- Cruise: ~50-80 kts

### Top Right - Altitude
- Measured in **feet** above sea level
- Start: 1,000 ft
- Safe minimum: 100 ft
- Go higher for better views!

### Middle Left - Orientation
- **Heading:** Direction you're facing (0° = North)
- **Pitch:** Nose up (+) or down (-)
- **Roll:** Wing tilt left (-) or right (+)

## 🎯 Flight Challenges

Try these once you're comfortable:

### Easy Challenges
1. **Circle Flight:** Make a complete 360° turn
2. **Altitude Hold:** Maintain 2,000 ft for 1 minute
3. **Speed Control:** Fly at exactly 60 knots

### Medium Challenges
1. **Low Flying:** Fly at 200 ft (don't crash!)
2. **City Tour:** Fly around all the buildings
3. **Speed Run:** Reach maximum speed

### Advanced Challenges
1. **Precision Landing:** Descend to 50 ft smoothly
2. **Aerobatics:** Try a barrel roll (full 360° roll)
3. **Night Flying:** Fly at night (use terrain for reference)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Stalling (Too Slow)
- **Problem:** Going below 20 knots
- **Fix:** Increase throttle immediately!

### Over-Pitching
- **Problem:** Pulling up too hard
- **Fix:** Small pitch changes work best

### Uncontrolled Roll
- **Problem:** Aircraft keeps rolling
- **Fix:** Tap opposite roll direction to level

### Too Fast on Descent
- **Problem:** Speeding up while going down
- **Fix:** Reduce throttle, pitch up slightly

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Small Inputs:** Gentle control movements work best
2. **Coordinated Turns:** Roll + pitch up = smooth turn
3. **Trim Concept:** Aircraft naturally levels roll over time
4. **Energy Management:** Speed = energy, altitude = potential energy
5. **Look Around:** Explore different altitudes for best views

## 🌍 Exploring

### Best Altitudes for Different Views

- **50-200 ft:** Street level, see buildings up close
- **500-1,000 ft:** City overview, see layout
- **2,000-5,000 ft:** Regional view, see terrain
- **10,000+ ft:** Continental view, see geography

### Interesting Things to Try

1. Fly between skyscrapers (carefully!)
2. Follow rivers and coastlines
3. Fly over mountains and valleys
4. Explore at different times of day
5. Try different weather conditions

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

Once you master the basics, try these:

### Barrel Roll
1. Build up speed (100+ knots)
2. Roll 90° to one side
3. Continue rolling while pulling up
4. Complete the 360° roll

### Loop
1. Build up speed (120+ knots)
2. Pull up hard
3. Keep pulling through the loop
4. Level out at the bottom

### Immelman Turn (180° direction change)
1. Start loop as above
2. At the top, roll 180°
3. Pull through and level out
4. You've reversed direction!

## 📝 Remember

- **Practice makes perfect!**
- **Don't be afraid to crash** (it's just a simulator!)
- **Experiment with controls** to learn how they feel
- **Watch the HUD** for feedback
- **Have fun!** 🎮
